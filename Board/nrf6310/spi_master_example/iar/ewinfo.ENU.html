SPI Master loopback example

DESCRIPTION
===========
 
   This example needs that the slave is configured to transmit the received bytes. That is the slave
  behaves as a loopback device for the master. The loopback can also be achieved without using a slave device at all by wiring MOSI and
  MISO pins of the spi master together. TX_RX_MSG_LENGTH number of bytes are transmitted through the master and the received bytes are
  verified to be the same as transmitted. IF there is an error, gpio pin for relevant spi module is set high to show the error ERROR_PIN_SPI0,
  ERROR_PIN_SPI1. If there is error from both modules that is if both pins are set high, then this application loops for ever

COMPATIBILITY
=============

   The example project is compatible with, on Nordic Semi nRF6310 - PCA10005 evaluation
  boards. By default, the project is configured to use the J-Link SWD interface.

CONFIGURATION
=============

   Make sure that the following jumpers and swiches are correctly configured on the
  nRF6310 evaluation board:
  Switches:
  S8  - VBUS
  S9  - ON
  S11 - ON
  
  PCA10005 board:
  Jumpers:
   K1 - 2-3
   P4 - 1-3 2-4 (32 kHz crystal)

  The Blinky application is downloaded to the iFlash.

GETTING STARTED
===============

  1) Build and download the program.

  2) Run the program.
